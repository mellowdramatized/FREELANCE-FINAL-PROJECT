                        is the most recent phone to come from Apple, coming in with a brand new ios version being the
                        new ios version 18 bringing alongside it many changes to general functions that have been a
                        little neglected over past years. The Iphone 16 Pro Max comes standard with a 120 hz and a 6.9
                        inch screen. Although under the screen it gets even more impressive with a new Apple A18 Pro
                        chipset which features a 6 core cpu which will be more than enough for anything you will need to
                        do.

                        Another great feature of the phone is its new picture button, a nice touch screen button on the
                        side of the camera to allow for the user to easily change between certain settings and modes all
                        with one single button. The Camera Control is not a physical button. It's a recessed tactile
                        switch on the right side of the iPhone 16 series that provides the feeling of a cli via a
                        capacitive sensor. With this control you can launch the camera with a press, then quily take a
                        photo with another press. And if you want to start a video, you just long press. But this is
                        just the start of what the Camera Control can do. You can toggle between multiple options — such

                        When shopping for a new model of phone it is important to also keep price in mind and with the
                        16 pro and pro max its really simple to handle the pricing of it. For the base model of the 16
                        pro it starts at $1449 with a 128gb storage drive and for the 16 pro max it comes in at $1749
                        with a 256 gb storage drive. Although both devices allow for additional storage upgrades.

                            This color scheme is great for most users, even though they may be kinda boring the colors
                            will fit well with the items they already have.

                        In conclusion, the Iphone 16 pro and the pro max both have great features but in the end the
                        extra caash for the pro max will be well worth it. The amount of extra features, the increased
                        storage, the camera quality, the bigger screen, these features are in my opinion make the extra
                        cash for the 16 pro max more worth it.
