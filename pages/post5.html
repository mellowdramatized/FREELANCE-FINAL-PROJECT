            <h2>1. Create a Dedicated Workspace</h2>
            <p>Establish a workspace that is free from distractions and separate from your relaxation areas. This helps
                to maintain a healthy work-life balance and improves focus during working hours.</p>

            <h2>2. Take Regular Movement Breaks</h2>
            <p>Sitting for long periods can have a negative impact on your physical health. Set reminders to stand up,
                stretch, and move around every hour to keep your body active and avoid stiffness.</p>

            <h2>3. Stay Hydrated</h2>
            <p>It's easy to forget about hydration when you're caught up in work. Keep a water bottle at your desk and
                sip throughout the day to stay hydrated and alert.</p>

            <h2>4. Establish Boundaries with Work Hours</h2>
            <p>Working from home can blur the lines between personal and professional time. Set clear boundaries by
                starting and ending your workday at consistent times to avoid overworking and burnout.</p>

            <h2>5. Practice Mindfulness and Relaxation</h2>
            <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. Incorporate mindfulness exercises, meditation, or
                simple breathing techniques into your day to reduce stress and maintain focus.</p>
