                <p>"Seatbelts on? Coolers packed? Nobody forgot the bug spray this time, right?" Sara called over her shoulder as she slid into the driver's seat.</p>
                <p>Joey waved a half-empty bottle like a trophy. "Got it!"</p>
                <p>Evan snatched it from him with a laugh. "Nice try—this is from last year. You were supposed to grab the new one from the garage."</p>

                <p>The roads narrowed as they drove north, trees swallowing the sky. By the time they reached the cottage, the air smelled of pine and lakewater. The first few days blurred into campfires and cannonballs off the dock, but on the fourth night, the storm rolled in like a warning.</p>
                
                <p>Rain lashed the windows. The power died.</p>
                
                <p>"Scary stories!" Michael announced, flashlight under his chin. "Once, a family like ours stayed in a cabin during a storm. On the fourth night..."</p>
                
                <p>A knock cut him off.</p>
                
                <p>Silence. Then—knock, knock.</p>
                
                <p>Evan moved toward the door, flashlight trembling. When he yanked it open, only wind howled back.</p>
                
                <p>"Not funny, Michael," Emily muttered.</p>
                
                <p>"Wasn't me!"</p>
                
                <p>Then—a whisper. Faint, desperate.</p>

            <section class="story-climax">
                <p>Evan's beam swept the trees. There, just beyond the gravel: a boy, maybe sixteen, soaked and shaking. "Help me," he rasped.</p>
                
                <p>They bundled him inside. His clothes were torn, skin ice-white. "I was lost," he stammered between sips of tea. "In the woods. The maze—"</p>
                
                <p>Emily's book hit the floor. "Did you say maze?"</p>
                
                <p>The boy looked up. Moonlight flooded the room—and the couch where he'd sat was empty. Just a damp blanket. A cold cup.</p>

                <p>No one slept. At dawn, Emily flipped open The Maze Runner, and her breath caught.</p>
                
                <p>Scrawled inside the cover, in handwriting none of them knew:</p>
