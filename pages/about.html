            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>
                As a programming enthusiast, I have experience with several languages, but my primary focuses are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C#</strong>: Ideal for game development and creating robust applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Java</strong>: My go-to language for cross-platform development and robotics programming.</li>
                <li><strong>Python</strong>: A versatile tool for data analysis, automation, and scripting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Currently, I am proud to serve as a programmer for my high school's FIRST Robotics team (#141). This role
                allows me to apply my skills to real-world challenges and collaborate with a talented group of peers. The
                experience has been both rewarding and instrumental in shaping my technical expertise and teamwork
                abilities.
