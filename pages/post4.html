            <h2>1. Prioritize Your Tasks</h2>
            <p>Start your day by creating a to-do list and categorizing tasks based on their importance. Focus on
                high-priority tasks first to ensure that your most critical work gets done.</p>

            <h2>2. Time Block Your Day</h2>
            <p>Time blocking is a great technique to manage your time efficiently. Set aside specific time slots for
                each activity or project to avoid distractions and stay focused on one task at a time.</p>

            <h2>3. Minimize Distractions</h2>
            <p>Identify the things that frequently interrupt your workflow, like social media or excessive
                notifications. Use tools like “Do Not Disturb” mode or browser extensions to block distracting websites
                during work hours.</p>

            <h2>4. Take Regular Breaks</h2>
            <p>Breaks are crucial for maintaining focus and avoiding burnout. Try the Pomodoro Technique—working for 25
                minutes and then taking a 5-minute break—to keep your mind fresh and energized.</p>

            <h2>5. Review Your Day</h2>
            <p>At the end of each day, take a few minutes to review what you’ve accomplished. This reflection can help
                you recognize progress, identify areas for improvement, and plan better for the next day.</p>
